# Recursion Exercises

Complete the functions written in the `recursion.js` file. 

You can automatically test your progress by running `npm install` inside this folder to install the automated testing libraries, then run `npm test` to see if your functions pass the test cases. You will have to add the necessary parameters to these functions so you can reference their usage inside the test file to see how the tests expect the function to be called.

#### Optional Challenge

The floodIt challenge asks you to write a recursive function in order to complete a jQuery-based floodIt game. You only need to fill in one function in `app.js` in order to complete the game functionality.
